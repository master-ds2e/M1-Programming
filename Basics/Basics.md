Operations
==========

Python and R can both work as classical calculator, using "+", "-", "\*" and "/" you can do arithmetic operations in both language.

``` python
# Python 

1+2
## 3
1-2
## -1
1/2
## 0.5
1*2
## 2
```

``` r
# R

1+2
## [1] 3
1-2
## [1] -1
1/2
## [1] 0.5
1*2
## [1] 2
```

You can also apply exponantiation, Modulo and floor division easily n both language. Please note that in R you can writte the exponantiation "^". You cannot do that in Python but both use "\*\*" for exponantiation. Use this one.

``` python
# Python 

2**8 # exponantiation
## 256
2^8 == 2**8 # FALSE
## False
8%3 # modulo
## 2
8//3 # floor division
## 2
```

``` r
# R

2**8 # exponantiation
## [1] 256
2^8 == 2**8 # TRUE
## [1] TRUE
8%%3 # modulo
## [1] 2
8%/%3 # floor division
## [1] 2
```
