# M1 Programming (6ETCS) 

This course is part of the second semester of M1 DS2E/SE. It aims at providing students with fundamental programming concepts including data structures, libraries, re-usable functions, efficient codes. Python and R programming languages will be used, both having become very popular for data science in academia and the private sector. The course will also focus on how to report results of data analysis using Markdown and hosts of source codes (GitHub).

The course is structured as follow:

- Chapter ‘Basics’ will go through the simplest operations we can perform. It covers the different types of objects present in the two languages, the use of control flows, and the creation of functions.
 

- Chapter ‘Arrays/Vectors’ introduces the use of vectors and matrices to perform operations. It highlights the benefits of vectorization and briefly discusses how to deal with sparse matrix.
 

- Chapter ‘Regex’ gives an overview of regular expression and string manipulation. It summarizes the first two chapters by applying the regular expressions in a very basic webscrapping exercise.
 

- Chapter ‘Data Analysis’, in R we will use of Tibbles and data.table to store data, while in Python we will focus on pandas. Basic operations on dataframe like slicing, filtering, grouping, merging are covered in the chapter as well as reading and writing data.
 

- Chapter ‘Best Practices’ is about coding in a conventional way to improve the readability of the code by others. It will also explain how to communicate and make your code accessible via github, but also how to produce reports or feed a blog with RMarkdown.
 

- Chapter ‘Efficient Programming’ is an introduction to parallel computing/generator/spars matrix.
