# Exercice 

There are XX groups in the class, the orals must be spread over 6 hours, in two 3-hour sessions.
We will want to take two 10-minute breaks in the middle of each session.
Write a program that randomly assigns a schedule to each group, write out this list of names and schedules in a table.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

test_py = pd.DataFrame(
    {
     'rank':[1,2,3],
     'name':['A','B','C']
     }
    )

``` 

- get your variable from python in R

```{r}
py$test_py

test_R = data.frame(
  'rank'=c(1,2,3),
  'name'=c('A','B','C')
  )

kableExtra::kable(py$test_py, 'latex', booktab = T)

```
